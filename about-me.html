								<p>
                  Hola! I'm delighted you want to learn more about me! I'm a physicist by training, with a strong foundation in computational physics and a passion for machine learning, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

                  <h3>My Background</h3>
                  Born and raised in Murcia, I discovered my love for physics and technology when trying to figure out how the world works. I pursued my passion by obtaining a B.S.c. and M.S.c. in Physics and Condensed-Matter Physics from the University of Murcia and Autonomous University Madrid. I continued to deepen my knowledge by earning a Ph.D. in Condensed-Matter & Computational Physics from the University of Murcia, where my research focused on Monte Carlo simulations in loop models.
                  
                  <h3>My Experience</h3>
                  Over the years, I've had the privilege to work as a postdoctoral researcher at esteemed institutions like the University of Oxford, ENS Paris, and the University of Murcia. My work spanned across various fields, including theoretical physics, neuroscience, and quantum algorithms and computational physics.
                  
                  My most recent ventures include co-founding Chat Ergo Bot and working as a Python developer. I have successfully developed chatbot platforms, machine learning solutions, and AI algorithms for various clients.
                  
                  <h3>My Skills</h3>
                  I am proficient in Python development, machine learning, deep learning, and web technologies. I have hands-on experience with tools like TensorFlow 2/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and NLP (and of course GPT!). Additionally, I have a solid background in programming languages like C++, R, PHP or FORTRAN as well as expertise in computing technologies like GNU/Linux, Jupyter, Docker, and Kubernetes.
                  
                  <h3>Languages</h3>
                  Besides my technical skills, I am a native Spanish speaker, proficient in English, and have intermediate fluency in French. I am learning Japanese.
                  
                  <h3>My Interests</h3>
                  Outside of my professional life, I love music. I love dancing lindy hop, salsa and many other styles. I also love playing music with the guitar, the saxophone or the piano. 
                  
                  I keep myself entertained with running, climbing, hiking, swimming.
